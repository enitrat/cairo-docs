# Associated items

"Associated Items" refers to a set of rules pertaining to items
of various types. It is an extension to `trait` generics, and allows
`trait`s to internally define new items.

One such item is called an _associated type_, providing simpler usage
patterns when the `trait` is generic over its container type.
