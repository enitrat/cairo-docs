# The Cairo Booklet

This booklet is a condensed version of [the Cairo Book](https://book.cairo-lang.org/), the manual for [the Cairo programming language](https://www.cairo-lang.org/). Its objective is to quickly on-board new developers to Cairo and provide a good overview on what the language is all about in a short period of time.

The booklet is work-in-progress and is fully open source. Found a typo or want to contribute? Check out the Cairo Booklet GitHub repository.
