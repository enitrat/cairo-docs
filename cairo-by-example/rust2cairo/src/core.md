# Core library types

The `core` library provides many custom types which expands drastically on
the `primitives`. Some of these include:

- growable `ByteArray`s like: `"hello world"`
- growable arrays: `array![1, 2, 3]`
- optional types: `Option<i32>`
- error handling types: `Result<i32, i32>`
- smart pointers: `Box<i32>`
