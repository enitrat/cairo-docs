Some topics aren't exactly relevant to how your program runs but provide you
tooling or infrastructure support which just makes things better for
everyone. These topics include:

- [Documentation][doc]: Generate library documentation for users via the included
  `scarb doc`.
- [Playground][playground]: Analyze your Cairo code in the Cairo Playground.
