# The `use` declaration

The `use` declaration can be used to bind a full path to a new name, for easier
access. It is often used like this:

```cairo, noplayground
{{#include ../../listings/mod/use_1/src/lib.cairo:main}}
```

You can use the `as` keyword to bind imports to a different name:

```cairo,editable
{{#include ../../listings/mod/use_2/src/lib.cairo}}
```
