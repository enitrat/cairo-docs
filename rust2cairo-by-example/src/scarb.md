# Scarb

`Scarb` is the official Cairo package management tool. It has lots of really
useful features to improve code quality and developer velocity! These include

- Dependency management and integration with [scarbs.xyz](https://scarbs.xyz) (the
  official Scarb package registry)
- Integration with [Starknet Foundry](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/) for testing and benchmarks

This chapter will go through some quick basics, but you can find the
comprehensive docs in [The Scarb Documentation](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/).
