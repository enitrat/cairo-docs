# Welcome to the Cairo Docs Hub!

This page serves as a starting point for exploring the ecosystem of guides, references, and learning materials around the Cairo programming language. All resources are open-source, so don't hesitate to fix a typo, improve an example, or even write an entirely new content while your're reading!

## Learning Cairo

If you’d like to learn Cairo, this is the place to start.

### The Cairo Book
[The Cairo Book](https://book.cairo-lang.org) is the go-to learning resource for the Cairo programming language. It introduces core concepts step by step, from basic syntax to writing and verifying provable programs. Designed for learners of all levels, it's a comprehensive guide to understanding and using Cairo effectively.

### Cairo By Example
[Cairo By Example](https://docs.cairo-lang.org/cairo-by-example) is a collection of minimal examples that demonstrate how to use features of the Cairo language. It’s organized by topic, making it easy to learn Cairo through short, focused code snippets, and ideal both for hands-on learners and as quick reference.

### Starklings
[Starklings](https://starklings.app/) is an interactive tutorial project designed to help you learn Cairo and Starknet development through practical exercises.

### The Starknet Agent
[Starknet](https://agent.starknet.id/) Agent is an open-source AI-powered searching tool specifically designed for the Starknet Ecosystem. It uses advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to search and understand the Starknet documentation, Cairo Book, and other resources, providing clear and accurate answers to your queries about Cairo and Starknet.

## Using Cairo

Once you're comfortable with Cairo, these resources will help you put it to use.

### The Cairo Core Library Docs
[The Cairo Core Library Docs](https://docs.cairo-lang.org/core) is the documentation for Cairo's Core library, the standard set of types, traits, and utilities built into the language. It provides essential building blocks basic used throughout the Cairo ecosystem, and is automatically available in every Cairo project.

### The Scarb documentation
[The Scarb documentation](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs.html) is the official documentation for Scarb, Cairo’s package manager and build tool. It covers how to create and manage packages, use dependencies, run builds, and configure projects. It’s the main reference for working with Scarb in Cairo development.

### The Starknet Foundry Book
[The Starknet Foundry Book](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/index.html) is the documentation for Starknet Foundry, a fast testing and development framework for Cairo smart contracts. It covers setup, test writing, cheatcodes, deployment, and integration with other tools. It's aimed at developers building and testing on Starknet efficiently.

### The Starknet Developer Hub
[The Starknet Developer Hub](https://www.starknet.io/developers/) is the official resource hub for learning about Starknet development. It provides comprehensive guides, tutorials, and references for building decentralized applications on Starknet, including how to write and deploy Cairo smart contracts, and best practices for working with the Starknet network.

## Mastering Cairo

Once you’re confident with Cairo, you can try diving into its more complex sides.

### The Cairo whitpaper
[The Cairo whitpaper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1063.pdf) is the original paper introducing Cairo by StarkWare. It explains Cairo as a language for writing provable programs, details its architecture, and shows how it enables scalable, verifiable computation without relying on trusted setups. The paper is technical and foundational for understanding Cairo's design.

### The CairoZero documentation
[The CairoZero documentation](https://docs.cairo-lang.org/cairozero)  is the official documentation for CairoZero, the original version of the Cairo language used to write provable programs. It includes beginner-friendly tutorials like “Hello, Cairo,” a deep dive into how Cairo works, and reference material for syntax, libraries, and SHARP integration.
