# Cairo by Example

[Cairo][cairo] is a modern programming language that lets you write ZK-provable programs without requiring a deep understanding of the underlying ZK concepts.
Its Rust-inspired design that makes it easy to build scalable dApps with the power of validity proofs.

Cairo by Example (CBE) is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Cairo
concepts and standard libraries. To get even more out of these examples, don't forget
to [install Cairo locally][install] and check out [The Cairo Book][book].
Additionally for the curious, you can also [check out the source code for this site][home].

Now let's begin!

- [Hello World](hello.md) - Start with a traditional Hello World program.

- [Primitives](primitives.md) - Learn about signed integers, unsigned integers and other primitives.

- [Custom Types](custom_types.md) - `struct` and `enum`.

- [Variable Bindings](variable_bindings.md) - mutable bindings, scope, shadowing.

- [Types](types.md) - Learn about changing and defining types.

- [Conversion](conversion.md) - Convert between different types, such as strings, integers, and floats.
