# Playground

The [Cairo Playground](https://www.cairo-lang.org/cairovm/) is a way to experiment with
Cairo code through a web interface.

You can compile your program to [Sierra and CASM](https://docs.starknet.io/architecture-and-concepts/smart-contracts/cairo-and-sierra/), and execute it instruction-by-instruction.
