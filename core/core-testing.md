# testing

Module for testing only. Measurement of gas consumption for testing purpose.  This module provides the `get_available_gas` function, useful for asserting the amount of gas consumed by a particular operation or function call. By calling `get_available_gas` before and after the operation, you can calculate the exact amount of gas used.
